    <p class="type-reflect">The texture of the images contrasts the rest of the photo due to its texture. This contrast prevents the poster looking 
        unexciting. I chose to use an oil pastel effect as it incorporates Bristol’s art culture, I wanted my posters to reflect different characteristics
         of Bristol as a city. Therefore, I went with a green colour scheme as a subtle nod to Bristol’s environmentally conscious views. The text acts as
          a border for the image to keep everything in close proximity each other. ‘Free and accessible for everyone’ is written in a white font to contrast 
          the other green texts, this also ensure it stands out as its position could easily missed. The monochromatic colour scheme adds a level of 
          repetition that is aesthetically pleasing to look at. To add to this, I kept all the text inside the hypothetical box that the image and extracted
           balloon creates, this forms these clean lines that add to the overall appearance.</p>

    <p class="type-reflect">I created a grid of hot air balloons and text which produced a visually pleasing neat composition. I contrasted the colour of the
         balloons which a dark background to ensure that they pop, and the first thing people see when they look at the poster. This layout was also inspired
          by rave posters to reflect Bristol’s nightlife. I also took conventions from music festival posters, such as a banner for the logos at the bottom of
           the print. To keep the repetition of the balloons from looking too consistent, I adjusted the hue of the images and grouped them based on their
            underlying primary colour.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="type-reflect">My aim for this poster was to improve on the presentation of text. With the first two posters, I wasn’t happy with how the text 
        appears, so I wanted to do something new for the final one. Originally, I was going to incorporate a radial typographic but during editing I decided
        to challenge myself and replicate the shape of an air balloon with the text. While I am happy with the results, the blue warped text can be difficult 
        to read in some areas. To improve this, I should adjust the shape of the text and consider using a different colour to outline the text in order to add
         some dimension, however the blue fits with the colour scheme so doesn’t look out of place.</p>
