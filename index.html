        <p class="type-reflect bg-text-1">Overall, I highly enjoyed the creative nature of this assignment. I was able to develop my photoshop
             as well as learning to use new software, such as Illustrator and Indesign. This proved to be very difficult at the start, but slowly
              I picked the basics, and it became easier to navigate. Learning HTML and CSS was a matter of practice and repeating the different 
              structures until it became easier. I had experience coding however my knowledge was very limited and was in a different language. 
              W3Schools was excellent tool to learn more techniques and allowed me to explore different options for the website. I found that 
              sketching out my ideas before making it helped me manage the workload. Therefore, this is a technique I will continue to use for 
              future assignments.</p>
